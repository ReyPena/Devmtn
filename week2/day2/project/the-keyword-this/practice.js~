//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?
      //Answer
      its a way to call a object, or a method of an object.

  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

      //Answer
      -explicit
      -implicit
      -default
      -new

  // 3) What is the difference between call and apply?

      //Answer
call calls a method of an object, substituting another object for the current object.
while Apply calls the function, substituting the specified object for the this value of the function, and the specified array for the arguments of the function.
  // 4) What does .bind do?

      //Answer
For a given function, creates a bound function that has the same body as the original function. In the bound function, the this object resolves to the passed in object. The bound function has the specified initial parameters.

//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    //Code Here
    var user = {
      username:"Reysexy",
      email:"sexy@hot.grrrr",
      getUsername: function (){
        return this.username;
      }
    }

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.

//Next Problem

console.log(user.getUsername());

// Write the function definitions which will make the following function invocations function properly.

  //Function Invocations Here
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.move = 0;
  this.moveCar = function () {
    this.move += 10;
    return this.move;
  }
}
var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013);

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.

//Hint, you'll need to write a moveCar function which is added to every object that is being returned from the Car function. You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the write object (prius vs mustang).

//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Using your prius and mustang objects from above, use the proper syntax that will allow for you to call the getYear function with the prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects. *Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

  //Code Here

getYear.call(prius);
getYear.call(mustang);

//New Problem



var user = {
  username: 'iliketurtles',
  age: 13,
  email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getUsername = function(){
  console.log(this.username);
};

setTimeout(getUsername, 5000);

//Above you're given an object, a function, and a setTimeout invocation. After 5 seconds, what will the getUsername function return?

  //Answer Here
  undefine "this" is not been use correctly


//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getUsername runs?

  //Answer Here
  in the example this this been use implicit, and is referin at the name of the name of the object (in the example this.username = getUsername.username)

//Fix the setTimeout invocation so that the user object will be the focal object when getUsername is ran.

var user = {
  username: 'iliketurtles',
  age: 13,
  email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getUsername = function(){
  console.log(user.username);
};

setTimeout(getUsername, 5000);
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var user = {
  username: 'iliketurtles',
  age: 13,
  email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getUsername = function(){
  console.log(this.username);
};

setTimeout(getUsername.call(user), 5000);
